# Pet Adoption Agency

This is a simple flask app for Springboard (again). Users can view pets that are up for adoption, put up pets for adoption (sad), as well as edit and delete pet instances. 

App runs on a flask server with WTForms and SQLAlchemy packages. 

DB is postgreSQL.

App is not currently operational, will update with full README and requirements eventually. Cheers!
